            It recently came to us that that people were afraid to pre-save our songs, trusting their data
            to third-party services.</p>
        <p>We agree that everyone should care about privacy, thus we decided to
            <strong>create our own pre-save service</strong>. We guarantee that we won't keep any private
            information, as we don't intend to provide you with any advertisements or other services
            whatsoever - we only care to deliver you our music in the best possible way.
        </p>
        <p>Here's what this service really does:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Follows Insane Driver's profile</li>
            <li>Follows Silicon Fortress's singles playlist</li>
            <li>Pre-saves Insane Driver's songs</li>
            <li>You can optionally add them to a playlist of your choosing</li>
        </ul>
